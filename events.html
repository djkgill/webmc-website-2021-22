          <h3>Industry Spotlight</h3>
          <p>
            WE BMC and Engineering Career Services collaborated to host the
            first Biomedical Engineering Industry Spotlight event! Undergraduate
            students who attended learned of the latest industry trends,
            different biomedical engineering businesses, and networked with
            industry professionals. The event consisted of pitches from industry
            experts to discuss their roles, and companies they work for. The
            event concluded with open networking where students had an
            opportunity to ask more questions and discuss potential employment
            opportunities.

          <h3>Graduate Panel</h3>
          <p>
            A panel made up of eight graduate students presented their path to
            graduate school and information on current and past research. This
            event gave students the opportunity to learn more about graduate and
            research possibilites in biomedical engineering. Students were able
            to network with the graduate students after presentations were
            complete.
